# BackgroundChanger
A simple wallpaper changer for Windows

Add wallpapers by adding them to the Wallpapers folder.  PNG or JPG files are acceptable.  The program will go through and set the files to the proper naming convention upon each run.

See the program code in the help-me branch (i couldn't push to the main one lmao fix coming soon hopefully)
